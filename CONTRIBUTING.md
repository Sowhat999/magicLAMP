We welcome all contributions, no matter how big or small.

## Report an Issue

If you think you've found a bug in magicLAMP, then please [report an issue](https://github.com/chrisnharvey/magicLAMP/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=)
using the GitHub issue tracker for the project.

Please provide as much detail as you can and follow the issue template as much as possible.

## Documentation Issues

If you've found an issue with the documentation, or would like to improve it in any way, then
we encourage that you don't open an issue, and instead submit a pull request with your proposed changes.

Our documentation is written in Markdown and GitHub has a built-in editor for markdown files. Just find
the file you want to amend, and click the edit button. GitHub will then guide you through the process of
submitting your change to the project.

## Request a Feature

Before submitting a Pull Request with a new feature, we suggest that you first [propose the feature](https://github.com/chrisnharvey/magicLAMP/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=)
in the issue tracker. This will allow us to discuss your feature request and decide whether or not
we think its right for the project.

## Pull Requests

When submitting code changes to magicLAMP, please follow the following guidelines.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the documentation and `README.md` is kept up-to-date.

- **Submit to the correct branch** - New features should be targeted at the `develop` branch, and hotfixes should target the `master` branch. We follow the [git-flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) workflow.

- **Create feature/hotfix branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature/fix** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
